# Aeonian Home Automation
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rcodonnell/Aeonian.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rcodonnell/Aeonian)

Application used for home automation.

## First Iteration
Mainly bootstrap the app with Plex features
* Plex Request
* Notifications


## Second Iteration
Pull the plex features out into their own modules and implement some sort of plugin system.
This will help people install only the features they need instead of an antire monolithic home automation program with features people don't even want.
